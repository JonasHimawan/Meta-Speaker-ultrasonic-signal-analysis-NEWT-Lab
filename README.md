# Meta-Speaker-ultrasonic-signal-analysis-NEWT-Lab
This project generates dual ultrasonic tones (20 kHz, 23 kHz) and records microphone data at 96 kHz for frequency-domain analysis. To ensure reliable detection of the expected 3 kHz difference-frequency component, the pipeline supports repeated trials and quantifies peak stability across runs. Spectral estimation uses windowing and averaged PSD methods to reduce leakage and lower the noise floor, and includes checks for practical constraints such as sample-rate limits, buffer sizing, and clipping risk during simultaneous playback/record.
